#Design patterns implemented in Java

The aim of this repository is to provide simple examples of some of the most important GoF patterns.

The pattern's implementations are inspired by the books "Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".

The project is structured in three main folders which divide the patterns by their type: creational, behavioural and structural.

There is a main program inside each pattern's folder named {PATTERN NAME}Program which can be executed to see the pattern working.
